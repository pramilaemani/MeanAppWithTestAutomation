# Mean Stack Application

This simple application is developed using MongoDB, Express, Angular and Nodejs(MEAN). 

Below information provided is just an overview of each technology used in the application.

## MongoDB:
Its is Lightweight, opensource document database which provides high performance. A table in mongoDB is called as a collection, a row is a document and a column is a field. Documents(objects) correspond to native data in many programming languages and hence makes it best fit for any language used.
It is not mandatory to have a specific schema for every document hence making it very flexible unlike other databases. The documents in MongoDB are similar to JSON objects and fields may contain arrays.
There is no need to use joins. 

Below are the basic commands that have been used for creating the collections, querying the collection and select queries.

### Install MongoDB:
Download and Install MongoDB from the link: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

### Create a DB:
use DATABASE_NAME is used to create database.
Ex: use prototypeDB

### Create a collection:
db.createCollection(name, options) where name is the name of the collection and options are the documents in the collection. Documents can be created along with 

### Insert Document into Collection:

### Query a Collection:

### Select Query:

## Express.js:
Express is a Nodejs web application framework which allows to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests. Each HTTP request has a corresponding URL which is used to render the HTML pages.
Express defines routing table which is used to perform different actions based on the HTTP method(GET, PUT, DELETE, POST) and URL.
